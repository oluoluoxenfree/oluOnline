**Preventative Measures**

Try to commit as often as you can; at least as often as you've added any significant feature or change. This makes it much easier to step back through history and find a place before you messed up.

Try to give yourself descriptive and well-formatted commit messages. A few too many 'WIP' and 'fixing bug' commits make any problems much harder to untangle.

**The Actual Fixes**

If you've never heard of it [Oh Shit, Git](https://ohshitgit.com/) is indispensible when you're first grappling with Git issues. Having things answered in plain English is really helpful when the panic of being in over your head sets in.

It's not a replacement for knowing Git well but it will take you a long way!

For a more in-depth look at the issues, [Wizard Zines](https://wizardzines.com/zines/oh-shit-git/) Git issue (also named Oh Shit, Git ha ha) is much more in-depth and explains why the commands work the way they do.

I hope this goes some way towards demystifying things!
